# Summer Vacation Research Summary

As of July 1st, my summer vacation officially began, and three weeks have already passed. Here's a chronological summary of my research progress and achievements.

## Week 1: Concept Map Integration and System Development

During the first week, I made significant progress in replacing CLIP with concept maps as explicit storage for spatial understanding. The Gaussian Memory Field now completely handles the imagination work without needing to dive into CLIP features.

I also completed the main components of the KARA system, including:

- **Concept map-based human-computer dialogue**: Implemented natural language interaction using spatial concept understanding
- **Top-down binary navigation graph**: Developed efficient path planning using hierarchical spatial representations

This week laid the foundation for a more robust and interpretable spatial reasoning system.

## Week 2: System Integration and Real-world Demonstrations

The second week focused on system integration and real-world testing. I conducted live demonstrations and recordings in three different environments:

- **Conference room**: Testing system performance in controlled indoor environments
- **Senior care facility**: Evaluating adaptability in complex living spaces
- **Unmanned supermarket**: Assessing navigation capabilities in commercial settings

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified:

- **Navigation limitations**: The system's path planning showed performance constraints
- **Point cloud mismatching**: Objects appeared as duplicates (ghosting effect) due to registration issues

Despite these challenges, the demonstrations successfully showcased the system's potential and highlighted areas for improvement.

## Week 3: Change Detection Research and Website Development

The third week was dedicated to advancing change detection capabilities and personal development:

### Research Progress:

- **Change detection strategy discussions**: Had detailed discussions with Li Xia and Jin Jin on implementation strategies for change detection
- **3DGSSlam recordings**: Completed real-world recordings in three scenarios, successfully reproducing the authoritative 3DGS-CD (3D Gaussian Splatting Change Detection) results
- **Algorithm robustness analysis**: Found that the current algorithm has limited robustness, only detecting significant scene changes

### Personal Development:

- **Personal website creation**: Built this blog website that you're currently reading - I'm quite pleased with the result!

## Future Plans (Next Two Weeks)

Looking ahead to the remaining two weeks of summer vacation, I plan to focus on:

- **Change detection integration**: Integrating and modifying the change detection algorithms
- **System optimization**: Addressing the performance bottlenecks identified during demonstrations
- **Algorithm robustness improvement**: Enhancing the change detection algorithm's sensitivity and reliability

## Key Achievements

1. **Conceptual breakthrough**: Successfully replaced CLIP with concept maps for spatial understanding
2. **System development**: Completed the main KARA system with dialogue and navigation capabilities
3. **Real-world validation**: Conducted comprehensive demonstrations in multiple environments
4. **Research advancement**: Made progress in change detection and 3D Gaussian Splatting
5. **Personal growth**: Developed technical and communication skills through presentations and discussions

## Technical Insights

The transition from CLIP to concept maps represents a significant architectural improvement, providing:

- **Better interpretability**: Spatial concepts are now explicitly represented
- **Improved efficiency**: Reduced computational overhead compared to CLIP feature extraction
- **Enhanced flexibility**: More adaptable to different spatial reasoning tasks

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- **Navigation optimization**: Need to improve path planning algorithms for better real-time performance
- **Point cloud registration**: Address ghosting issues through better registration techniques
- **Change detection robustness**: Develop more sensitive algorithms for subtle scene changes
